# Abstract Data Types
Towards the end of 1917, we looked at different data structures, particularly linked lists and binary trees. These are what we call abstract data types, or ADT's. When developing an ADT, we write functions to manipulate them, but we abstract these functions away from the programmer. This means, if you're using, for example, a linked list ADT, you don't need to access members in the struct or truly need to know whats happening under the hood to use it.

## Stacks
A stack is similiar to an array, except that we only have 2 operations, `push` and `pop` (some implementations may have a `peek` operation). So this means we cannot (or rather should not) access random elements in the array. A stack can be implemented with either an array or a linked list, but we will deal with an array implementation here.

Think of a stack as a stack of plates, where we can only remove the top plate, and add a plate to the top. Removing the plate is our `pop` operation and adding a plate is our `push` operation. To translate this to code, we need an array, an `int` to keep track of which element in the array is the top element. We also need an `int` to keep track of the maximum size of the array so we don't overstep our bounds. Pushing to a full stack is called a stack overflow, and popping off an empty stack is a stack underflow. Below is the struct for a stack.

```c
typedef struct _stack{
	int * data;
	int top;
	int maxSize;
}*Stack;
```

Now to push an element to the stack, we just write our data at the `top`'th element of `data`, and increment `data`.

```c
void push(Stack s, int value){
	s->data[s->top++] = value;
}
```

Popping off the stack is the same thing in reverse.
```c
int pop(Stack s){
	return s->data[s->top--];
}
```
Notice how we don't 'delete' the data popped off, as that data will be overwritten when the time comes.

A stack has the **FILO** (first in last out) property.

## Queues
A queue is similiar to a stack, but has two major distinctions. Instead of `push`ing and `pop`ing off a queue, we `enqueue` and `dequeue`. This is similiar to a queue at a supermarket, were new customers are placed at the end of the queue, and the first customers have priority. A queue is a tad bit harder to implement in `C`, as dequeuing an element requires all the elements in the array to shift down. If our implementation used a linked list, it would become a much easier problem to deal with.

A stack has the **FIFO** (first in first out) property.

## Linked Lists
Read up on the 1917 page to catchup on linked lists. For now, we are going to develop a slightly different implementation of a list. We will have a list struct that contains pointers to the heads and tails of a list, as well as a 'string' of nodes.
```c
typedef struct _list{
	link head;
	link tail;
	int size;
}*List;
```
and each node looks like
```c
typedef struct _link{
	int data;
	link next;
}*link;
```
There are other types of linked lists, like doubly linked lists, where each node contains a pointer to both the next node in the list, as well as the previous. We will cover this later. Let's write a list of operations we can do to a linked list.
 - create
 - append
 - concatenate two lists
 - search
 - sort
 - destroy

This might be a lab task for you, so I won't go through most of the answers. Let's try a somewhat simple prac question, concatenate. Now, as we have pointers to both heads and tails of the list, we don't need to traverse through the entire list to reach the end. We can simply link up the tail of one list to the head of the other.
```c
List concat_list(List a, List b){
	if(a->head == NULL) return b; // concatenating empty lists
	if(b->head == NULL) return a;

	a->tail->next = b->head; // link up the tail of a to the head of b
	a->size += b->size; // adjusting the size
	a->tail = b->tail; // repointing to the new tail

	b->head = b->tail = NULL; // and now to empty list b
	b->size = 0;
	return a;
}
```
Always check the struct in a prac exam and adjust your formula accordingly. Sometimes you won't have a `tail` pointer, and will need to traverse through the list.

## Binary Search Trees
Recall that a tree is a data structure that has two children, a `left` and a `right` child. For binary search trees, depending on the value of the current node, node with smaller values will be appended to the `left` branch, while larger ones to the `right`. This dramatically cuts down search times. To append a node to a tree, we need to have a thorough understanding of recursion.

```c
treelink appendBST(treelink root, treelink new){
	if(root == NULL) return new;
	else if(new->data > root->data) root->right = appendBST(root->right,new);
	else if(new->data < root->data) root->left = appendBST(root->left,new);
	return root;
}
```

There are 4 ways to traverse through a tree:
 - preorder 	(LRN)
 - inorder		(LNR)
 - postorder 	(NLR)
 - level order

The first 3 are implemented using a stack, while level order traversals are implemented using a queue. Recall that recursive functions are just a quick and dirty way to use a stack, because the way that the call stack works.

An incredibly easy exam question is to write down the pre-order, post-order and inorder traversals of a tree. There's a neat trick to this. For each node:
 - if preorder: draw a line to the left of each node
 - if inorder: draw a line to the bottom of each node
 - if postorder: draw a line to the right of each node

Then, draw a tight outline along all the nodes. Starting from the top node, follow the outline and write down the node value whenever the outline intersects with the lines from the nodes.

For level order, just write down the values level-by-level. 

### Preorder Traversal
This traversal goes through the left most child first (L), then the right (R), and then the function thats meant to happen (N). This can be remembered by (LRN). As we visit the left most branch first, then right, in a BST, this will result in a traversal where all the elements are in ascending order. Let's write a function that prints out a preorder traversal of a tree.

```c
void printPreorder(treelink root){
	if(root==NULL){
		printf("\n");
		return;
	}
	printPreorder(root->left); // (L)
	printPreorder(root->right); // (R)
	printf("[%d]",root->data) // (N)
}
```

### Inorder Traversal
We go to the left-most child, do what we do with our current node, then to the right most child.

```c
void printInorder(treelink root){
	if(root==NULL){
		printf("\n");
		return;
	}
	printPreorder(root->left); // (L)
	printf("[%d]",root->data) // (N)
	printPreorder(root->right); // (R)
}
```

### Postorder Traversal
And as you can guess...

```c
void printInorder(treelink root){
	if(root==NULL){
		printf("\n");
		return;
	}
	printf("[%d]",root->data) // (N)
	printPreorder(root->left); // (L)
	printPreorder(root->right); // (R)
}
```

### Level Order Traversal
This is probably a lab question, will leave it to you, but heres a clue: you need to use a Queue.
## PriorityQueues and Heaps

# Time Complexity

# Sorting
To sort a list of elements means to rearrange the list such that each element is in ascending order. Turns out there are plenty of ways to do this, each differing in efficiency. You will need to know the time complexities of each sort and their shortcomings. A particularly good exam question (and a lab prac) is to determine a given sort based on its behaviour with various types of input.

As lecture notes online videos seem to suffice teaching this, I will not go in depth with sorts, but rather list the step-by-step instructions for each sort.
## Bubble Sort

1. Loop through array, check if $n^{th}$ element is greater than the $n+1^{th}$ element.
2. If it is, swap the pair and continue traversing the list.
3. If a swap was made through a traversal of the array, go back to step 1. If not, you're array is sorted.

## Insertion Sort
## Selection Sort
## Quicksort
## Mergesort

# Graphs
Graphs are a data structure that describes the connections of multiple nodes through multiple connections, like airports via airplanes or ports via ships. Each 'airport' or 'port' is called a vertex, and the pathways between vertices are called edges. Edges have an associated weight to them, something to describe the cost of traversing across that edge. In a real world scenario, it could be the distance between towns. Edges can also be directional, that is, you can only cross an edge in a particular direction. A diagram of a sample graph is shown below:

## Graph Representations
First thing we need to do is to give each vertex or node a number. Using this number, we can describe the edges between the nodes.
### Adjaceny Matrix
Using a 2 dimensional array, we can not only specify whether or not two vertices are connected, but we can also store the weights of the edges in the array. The struct and the diagram of the 2d array we will create is shown below.

```c
typedef struct _graph{
	int nE;			// number of edges
	int nV;			// number of vertices
	int **matrix;	// 2d array
}*Graph;
```
Remember, to create a 2 dimensional array, we need to dynamically alloacte space for it (in the case of not knowing the size at runtime). To do that, first we allocate space for an array of pointers. Then we loop through that  array and allocate an array's worth of space for each element. 
```c
Graph createGraph(int nV, int nE){
	Graph g = malloc(sizeof(struct _graph));
	g->nE = nE;
	g->nV = nV;

	g->matrix = malloc(sizeof(int *) * nV);
	int i;
	for(i=0; i < nV; i++){
		g->matrix[i] = calloc(sizeof(int) , nV);
	}
	return g;
}
```
Note that `calloc` is allocates space just like `malloc` but intialises everything to 0. We are using a 0 in the matrix to mean that two vertices are not connected, while any other non-zero number suggests the vertices are connected with that weight.

If you had noticed, in the case of an undirected graph, we waste a bit of space in our array. To fix this, we can cut our array down to half its size and use a bit of clever maths to make our ADT look like it uses a 2d matrix. I'll leave this to you.

To add an edge is pretty simple,
```c
void addEdge(Graph g, Edge e){
	g->matrix[e->u][e->v] = g->matrix[e->v][e->u] = e->weight;
}
```
where an `Edge` is a struct that looks like
```c
typedef struct _edge{
	int u;
	int v,
	int weight;
}Edge;
```

You don't have to use an `Edge` struct, but often it makes life a bit easier by bundling this vertices up.

To delete a graph, we need to `free()` everything we `malloc`'d space for, in the right order. We don't want to be in a position to have to access something we've already freed, to free something else.

```c
void destroyGraph(Graph g){
	// first free each of the smaller arrays in our matrix
	int i;
	for(i=0; i<g->nV; i++) free(g->matrix[i]);

	// now free the big array that contained all the pointers
	free(g->matrix);

	// now free the malloc'ed space for the Graph itself
	free(g);
}
```

A benefit to using an adjaceny matrix is the constant access times to the vertex nodes.

### Adjacency List
For the adjaceny list representation, we use an array of linked lists to describe the edges, where the contents of the n'th linked list describe the adjacent vertices to vertex n. As we need to search through the entire linked list when looking for an adjacent vertex, searching the graph has time complexity O(n).

```c
typedef struct _graph{
	int nV;
	int nE;
	link * adjacents;
}*Graph;

typedef struct _node{
	int vertex;
	struct _node * next;
}*link;
```

To find whether, lets say, node a is adjacent to node n, we:
```c
typedef int Vertex;

int isAdjacent(Graph g,Vertex a, Vertex n){
	link curr = g->adjacents[a]; // could use the n'th element if this was an undirected graph
	while(curr!=NULL){
		if(curr->vertex == n) return 1;
		curr = curr->next;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
This is just a simple traversal over a linked list, with an early exit.

## Searching Graphs
The type of problems we encounter when dealing with graphs tend to rely on some sort of traversal of the graphs. Problems like:
 - what is the cheapest cost to get from a-b
 - are two graphs identical?
 - can we go through each edge and end up in the place we started (Euler tour)
### Breadth First Search
BFS traversals need the use of a queue. There are plenty of video tutorials on this, so I won't go in detail, but I will write a step-by-step set of instructions.

1. Add starting vertex to queue
2. Enqueue all adjacent unvisited nodes.
3. Dequeue next node and mark as visited.
4. Goto 2. If the queue is empty, you have traversed through the graph (if its fully connected).

### Depth First Search
DFS traversals follow the same steps as BFS, but we use a stack instead of a queue. Because we use a stack, we can actually utilise the function call stack and implement this recursively. The code is given in Angela's lecture notes.

1. Add starting vertex to stack
2. Enqueue all adjacent unvisited nodes.
3. Dequeue next node and mark as visited.
4. Goto 2. If the stack is empty, you have traversed through the graph (if its fully connected).

### Prim's
### Dijkstra's

## Paths and Tours
A path is a traversal of the graph such that we pass every edge or vertex **only** once. A tour is the same as the path, except, once we finish our traversal, we need to end up at the same vertex we started at.
### Euler
An Euler path requires us to pass every edge only once, and there is an easy way to determine whether a graph has an Euler tour. 

**Remember: an euler tour is still an euler path!**

#### Euler Path
##### Undirected Graph
An undirected graph has an euler path if and only if:
 - exactly **0** or **2** vertices have an odd degree
 - the non-zero degree vertices are a singly connected component

##### Directed Graph
A directed graph has an euler path if and only if at most:
 - one vertex has (out-degree) - (in-degree) = 1
 - one vertex has (in-degree) - (out-degree) = 1
 - every other vertex has (in-degree) = (out-degree)
 - and all of the non-zero degree vertices belong to a single connected component

#### Euler Tour
##### Undirected Graph
An undirected graph has an euler tour if and only if:
 - every vertex has even degree
 - the non-zero degree vertices are a singly connected component
##### Directed Graph
A directed graph has an euler tour if and only if at most:
 - every vertex has (in-degree) = (out-degree)
 - the non-zero degree vertices are a singly connected component

### Hamilton
A Hamilton path is similiar to an Euler path, except we need to traverse every **vertex** in the graph. There is no (as of yet) easy way to compute whether a graph contains a Hamilton Path. To determine whether a graph has a Hamilton path, we must conduct a graph traversal on every node, which is incredibly inefficient. Doubt this would be an exam question though, unless you do this course in s1||s2. In summer you don't get the John's Algorithm Almanac.

# Hash Tables
One issue with both linked lists and arrays is that to search for an element, in the absolute worst case scenario, we search through every element, leaving us with a time complexity of 0(n). Binary search trees are somewhat more efficient, sorting the data during insertion. But to have constant time search, that is, a search with time complexity O(1), we need to use something called hash tables. 

A hash table is essentially an array, but we pass in our data into a 'hash' function to find the index of where it will be placed in the table. This function usually looks something like

	h(x) = x % tablesize

Where `tablesize` is the size of the array, and should be prime. That `%` is the mod operator, the remainder if divided by `tablesize`. Our table size should be relatively prime so we can reduce collisions. A collision is when different inputs have the same hash output. To search for a particular entry in our table, we just hash what we are search for to find the index. i.e

```
Hash Table:
[][][][][][][][][][][][][]
Hash Function:
h(x) = x % 13

Lets enter the number 16 into the table.
h(16) = 16%13 = 3

So now our table looks like
[][][16][][][][][][][][][][]

If we want to check whether 16 is in our table, we hash 16, which is 3.
Then we check the 3rd element of the table.
```

## Collision Resolution
Hash functions aren't perfect, and there are cases where we get collisions, where multiple entries map to the same index in the table. For these cases, there are 3 different methods of collision resolution.
### External Chaining
For this method, every element in the table is a pointer to a linked list. Any collisions are appended to the end of the linked list.

```
Hash Table:
[][][][][][][][][][][][][]
Hash Function:
h(x) = x % 13

Lets enter the number 16 into the table.
h(16) = 16%13 = 3

So now our table looks like
[][][16][][][][][][][][][][]

Let's add 3 to the table now:
h(3) = 3

[v][v][v][v][v][v][v][v][v][v][v][v][v]
       |
      [16]
       |
      [3]

Since 3 collides with 16, its appended to the end of the 3rd linked list.

Remember that every element in the array is a pointer to the head of a linked list.
```

|Pros|Cons|
|-|-|
| |Worst case scenario, O(n) search time|

### Linear Probing
To resolve collisions with linear probing, if we find a collision, we move our new entry to the next available slot.

```
Hash Table:
[][][][][][][][][][][][][]
Hash Function:
h(x) = x % 13

Lets enter the number 16 into the table.
h(16) = 16%13 = 3

So now our table looks like
[][][16][][][][][][][][][][]

Let's add 3 to the table now:
h(3) = 3

[][][16][3][][][][][][][][][]

Since 16 is already occupying that spot, 3 will go in the next empty spot.
```

|Pros|Cons|
|-|-|
| |Searching for items can become a O(n) task|
| |Deleting an item that had a collision can throw up issues|

### Double Hashing
For double hashing, we do the same thing as in linear probing, but instead of incrementing by one to search for the next avaiable slot, we pass our entry through another hash function. The result of this second hash function will be our increment. Our second hash function usually looks similiar to our first hash function, except we add 1.

```
h(x) = x % 13
h2(x) = x % 7 + 1
```
As our second hash function dictates our increment, we cannot have an increment of 0, otherwise we would be stuck in an infinite loop. x%7 will return a number between 0 and 6, (x%7)+1 will return a number between 1 and 7.

```
