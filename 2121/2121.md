# AVR ISA / Programming

## The Chip
The AVR Industry Standard Architecture (AVR ISA) is governed by the AVR Instruction set and includes:

1. Load-Store memory access architecture
	+ This means all calculations are done on registers, not memory directly. 
	+ Memory is used to **load** to registers or **store** the registers contents. 
2. Two-Stage instruction pipelining
	+ This just means that the processor is designed to split up each instruction into multiple steps
	allowing for the processor to run multiple instructions in parallel. This increases speed as the processor
	can start another instruction before finishing the first as some parts of the new instruction use pieces of the 
	processor not currently active in the previous instructions computation. 
3. Internal Memory
4. lots of on-chip peripherals (hardware add-ons)

## General Registers
The AVR chipset has 32 8-bit registers that are extremely quick to access and work with.
We split these up into two groups, the 0-15 registers (`r0-r15`) and 16-31 (`r16-r31`)
This is because some instructions will only be able to function when working with
registers of the second higher number groups. This is because most instructions only have 16 bits to work with so for a command like `ldi` you have
```
1110 kkkk aaaa aaaa
```
`1110` indicates the command, `kkkk` is the return register and `aaaa aaaa` is the address to 
read from. As there are only 4 bits to store the return register, it can only return  to a maximum of 16 different registers. Hence why it only works on the second group of registers.


The following register pairs are commonly used as address indexs
* X - r27:r26
* Y - r29:r28
* Z - r31:r30

Note: Data that is loaded is often loaded into `r0`.

## I/O Registers

64 + 416 8 bit registers are used in input and output instructions. Mainly for storing data/instructions and control signal bits (to interact with hardware).

Some instructions will only work with I/O registers and not general purpose registers. For example `in Rd, port` will only work with an I/O register 0-63 and `lds Rd, port` will only work for io registers 64-415.
(covered in more detail in the I/O register section)

The **Status Register** in AVR is a special I/O register contains information about the most recent arithmetic instruction. 
flags allow us to extract different information about it. SREG is updated after any ALU operations by hardware. it is a 8 bit section of memory and contains 8 signal bits (in the order 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-0)

| Bit | Flag | What it does                                                  |
| --- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  7  |  I   | global interrupt enable, used to enable and disable interrupts |
|  6  |  T   | Bit Copy Storage, the bit copy instruction bld (Bit load) and bst (bit store) use the T-bit as a source or destination for the operated bit. If a bit needs to be put somewhere or read in, it is done so from here.|
| 5   |  H   | half carry flag indicates a half carry (carry from bit 4) has occurred in some math|
| 4   |  S   | Exclusive OR between the Negative flag (N) and the Two's complement overflow Flag (V). tells you the sign of the resultant number taking into account if overflow has occurred. i.e what the sign SHOULD BE |
| 3   |  V   | two's complement overflow flag triggers when overflow happens during two's complement arithmetic.|
| 2   |  N   | the negative flag is the most significant bit of the result, i.e is this number negative or not.|
| 1   |  Z   | Z indicates a zero result in some logic or arithmetic operation.|
| 0   |  C   | Carry Flag, its meaning depends on the operation, for example for addition it is the carry from the most significant bit, for subtraction it indicates if the result is negative ( for x-y C is 1 when y > x)|
##AVR Address Spaces

There are 3 address spaces:

**Data Memory Space**

This includes the registers and also System Ram (SRAM).
Note the highest point in this memory is called RAMEND. 

<img src="data_memory.png" width = "264" height="278"/>

**Program Memory Space**

This includes 16 bit flash memory which is read only. Here the 
instructions are stored. it's non-volatile, which means at sudden power
cuts the data in this is retained. 

If you know what you are doing you _CAN_ access these through lpm and spm. 

<img src="program_memory.png" width = "247" height="233"/>

**EEPROM Memory Space**

8-bit EEPROM memory is sued to store large data sets permanently. 
not covered in this course. (but can be loaded and set to)

##AVR Instruction Format
most instructions are 1 word long, although a select few are 2 words long 
such as lds (load from data space) which reads 1 byte from SRAM and thus needs to be able to 
take in larger addresses (0 - 65535)

example of a 16 bit command is add `0001 01rd dddd rrrr`
the last 6 bits (read from right to left) are the op code, the r is the register to read in from 
and the d is the destination. they each take up their own nibble (4 bits) but because we need 32 possible values
we chuck in the last 2 bits on the remaining 2 bits. hence the weird 01rd. the reason this happens is because they want to keep the destination near the middle so it matches somewhat the ldi encoding hence the r has to split. 

example of a 32 bit command is jmp `1001 010k kkkk 110k kkkk kkkk kkkk kkkk` jump will look at the k ADDRESS and jump to that place. often we use labels to refer to some address and use that here (discussed more in addressing) so we don't have to memoruse long ass addresses. note k can be 0 to 4 megabytes which is the theoretical maximum address but realistically we use values much more close to the lower end. 

PC is program counter. jmp sets it to k. PC <-- k. this is slow and takes 3 clock cycles. 

so there are also commands like `breq k` which is branch if equal. takes a address to jump to, but can only jump 64 up or 64 down from the current PC. as this takes up 7 bits we can fit the whole isntruction into 1 word. it will check the last comparison done and if it was true, it will branch else do nothing and progress the commands. 
Remember the Z flag, it is set if the result of the last command was 0. Because comparisons just subtract two numbers, if a comparison or really subtraction results in 0, Z will be set to 1, and the two elements are equal. 
if Z=1 PC <-- PC+k+1 else PC <-- PC+1
note it takes 1 clock cycle if it's false but 2 if it needs to branch(jump). 
`11100kkkkkkk001`
the weird order is basically random.

AVR has a couple of classes of instructions, things like arithmetic and logic, logic being things such as AND, it also has data transfer instructions, program control instructions (jump, skips, subroutine etc.) and good old bit operations. 
there are also other instructions like sleep or nop. Nop is no operation, just a empty cycle of the processor. 
##AVR Addressing modes 

there are 3 main ways AVR refers to addresses. 

**Immediate Addressing**

this is when the operands come FROM the instruction call itself.
You immediately give the instruction what it needs. 

if you wanted to clear the last 4 bits of r16 you would say
`andi r16, 0x0F` also note that a 4 bit block can be call a nibble.
here we are clearing the upper nibble. (it's an AND operation)

**Register Direct Addressing**

when the operands come from general purpose registers or I/O registers. 

`add r16, r0` or `in r25, PINA`

note the in command takes the signal from pin A and puts it in r25. 

**Data Memory Addressing**

there are multiple types of data memory addressing shown below

1. data direct addressing, the address of the memory needed is given
	* `lds r5, 0xF123`
2. indirect addressing, the address is referred to by a address pointer, such as the previously mentioned X Y or Z
	* `ld r11, X`
3. indirect addressing with displacement, just taking a address pointer and shifting it over
	* `std Y+10, r14`
4. indirect addressing with pre-decrement, The data memory address is from an address pointer (X, Y, Z) and the value of the pointer is auto-decreased before each memory access. basically reduce/increase y by 1 permanently, then access the new y address. 
	* `std -Y, r14`
5. indirect addressing with post-decrement, same as above but the value is increased _AFTER_ the memory is used

**Program Memory Addressing**

Similarly, there are multiple types of program memory addressing

1. Direct Program Addressing- the instruction has the address within it
	* `jmp` PC <-- k
2. Relative Program Addressing - the instruction has a k encoded that is added to the current PC.
	* `rjmp k` PC <-- PC + k + 1
	* note rjump is quicker and smaller hence we use it
	* jmp is mostly used for jumping far away (larger programs)
3. Indirect Memory Addressing - the instruction address is implicity stored in Z register (X Y Z)
	* `icall` this takes whatever is in the Z register and jumps there. 
	* allows for runtime decisions of where to jump (rarely used)
4. Program Memory Constant Addressing, the address of the constant is stored in Z register. a constant is something which we won't change, like the name of the program. 
	* `lpm r16, Z` r16 <-- Z
5. Program Memory Addressing with post-increment - increments z after it reads in 
	* `lpm r16, Z+`
##Control Structures 

##Commands
note: In AVR a *word* is a 16 bit value

| Command   | Function | Words | Cycles | Comments       |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------|----------------|
| `sub Rd, Rr`| Rd - Rr  | 1     |      1 | Subtraction without carry |
| `mul Rd, Rr`| Rd*Rr    | 1     |      2 | Multiply two 8 bit values, the resulting 16 bit value is stored in `r1:r0`. If bit 15 is `1`, the carry flag will be set, but does not indicate an overflow.| 
| `ldi Rd, k` | Rd <- k | 1 | 1| Load register `d` with value in address `k` |
| `mov Rd, Rr`| Rd <- Rr | 1| 1| Copy value in register `r` into `d` |
| `add Rd, Rr`| Rd + Rr | 1| 1| Addition without carry |
##Example

To calculate `z = 2x - xy - x^2`, first we load our values, then we calculate the expression step by step (remember the order of operations).

Note: Because we are using `mul` at some point, we will get a 16 bit value, however, for the purpose of this example, we are assuming the answer will be 8 bits at the greatest. 

Assuming `x`, `y` and `z` are stored in `r2`, r3 and `r4` (`r0` and `r1` are used by `mul`)

```
ldi r16, 2      		r16 <- 2;		// r16 because we are guaranteed all instructions will work
mul r16, r2     		x*2;
mov r5, r0      		r5 <- x*2;
mul r2, r3      		y * x;
sub r5, r0      		r5 <- 2x - y*x;
mul r2, r2      		x*x;
sub r5, r0      		r5 <- 2x-y*x - x^2;
mov r4, r5      		finish;
```

Note: using `mul` uses 2 cycles, so it is preferable that we minimise the amount of times we multiply two numbers. From the expression above, we can see that we can factor the `x` out.
