#Course Info
The course is basically to hone software construction skills in general 

Lectures consist of lots of examples, to revise lectures / watch them, really just set up the examples, follow through the building in the lecture and then play with it afterwards to get a feeling for how it is, modify it compile it etc. get a feel for the construction and the process. (less notes, more practice) but also take notes as you are playing around

Read up tutorial notes / activities before hand so you know what you need to get help on

Weeks 1-6 has no hard assessments
After that u are fucked in the ass so hard you can taste the comp2041

No group work in this course.

##Byte streams
Running a program on unix and having it interact with the outside world involves taking in information or sending out information via a byte stream. Stdin stdout stderror. 

When you get Segmentation fault (core dumped) the core is in reference to the olden days where a donut of magnetic material held bits. 
Learn the history of computing so we donâ€™t repeat the mistakes of the past

The difference between strerr and strin is mostly convention, it also allows us to separate error messages to a log file and std in somewhere else. 

Also buffer things. 

Note 
input stream 0 
Output steam 1 
Err 2

When gcc sets up your c program it adds in some code to open up and manage the input and output streams

Fopen gives you a byte stream from or going to a file. 

Other byte streams might lead to another device or over the internet to a computer. 

you can also pass in info via the argv 

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void){
	//direct request to operating system to 
	//write to a data stream (1 is stdout)
	write(1, "Andrew Rocks\n", 13);
	//write should not be used because it might be
	//absent from another platform
	//it's unix specific. 
	//printf is defined on most C systems within stdio.h
	//not embedded systems though to save space, a microwave 
	//does not need printf
	printf("Andrew Rocks\n");
	//note printf is a subset of fprintf which is set to print
	//to stdout
	return 0;
	//there is also exit which ends not just the function
	//but the PROGRAM
	exit(0); 
}
```

##Unix filters

* Unix shell also has special characters such as white space, the shell uses white space to seperate words, argv is set up depending on the spaces between strings. other ones are stuff like 
	* > or < to direct files. 
	* `filter < input1 input2 input3 > output`
* A file is (by the simplist and precisest definition) an array of byte
* a pipeline '|' allows two programs to be run at once with the output (stdout byte stream) of the first direction into another
	* `echo "Hello World" | reverse` outputs dlroW olleH
* the strace command can give you some info about a program that you don't know about, as it tells you the stack trace
* note control-D makes the os simulate a EOF to the byte stream.
* cat is short for cataonate, you can use it to collapse multiple files into one as well as echoing our file contents / stdin
	* `cat file1 file2 file3 file4 > all1`
* egrep can be given a pattern and it will only accept lines/input that matches the pattern
	* `egrep Zain` will only echo back the line you give it if it includes Zain
	* Can be given a flag to be case insensitive -i
	* the first argument is always a pattern, anything after are interperted as file names. 
	* `egrep main code.c` will return all the lines with main in them
* more / less are programs that organise a lot of data into pages
* wc will take in input and tell you how many lines, words and letters where in the input
* thus `egrep COMP2041 enrollments | wc` tells you how many people are enrolled in 2041!! one line <3
* grep is a cutdown version of egrep
* if you wanted to find a single charecter like F though, it will pick up lines with f in them at any point in any word. this is where we need ot use regular expressions
	* `F$` (with backticks)
* regexp helps defines a set of strings usually thoguht as as a pattern. these are avialable for most languages.
* The pipe character in regular expressions specifies "OR" 'COMP2041|COMP9041' means to pick out lines that match either.
* astrixs in regualr expressions are also special egrep 'ba*d'
	* This will grab any line with bad in it, but there can be 0 or infinite instances of a. i.e bd bad baaad baaaaad 
* To the shell the '' quote symbol exscapes any special charecters so shell won't interpert that line but just send it on the egrep
*
