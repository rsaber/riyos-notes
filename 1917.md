# Command Line Interface
## Choosing an OS
Really can't be bothered writing this part. Just read up on the tutorials on WebCMS or ask your tutor. But if you're using Windows right now, uninstall it and install Ubuntu.

## Using the Command Line
Most of us who have used a computer before (which I'm guessing is all of you), have probably only interacted with the computer through a Graphical User Interface, or GUI. This method of interaction involves clicking a mouse on shiny icons and watching pretty animations maximise and minimise a window. In COMP1917, we will need to learn a new way to use a computer, namely the Command Line Interface. Every command you make to the computer is written in text. We will go through basic UNIX commands, so have a UNIX or Mac OS X machine at the ready (use PuTTY and `ssh` into CSE if you're on a PC). When you open terminal, you'll be greeted with
```bsh
weill$
```
(or something similiar). From here, you can issue commands to navigate around folders and open files. Type in ls to see the list of files inside your working directory. Here's a list of basic UNIX commands you need to be familiar with:

|**UNIX Command**   |**Description**|
|-|-|-|
|`ls`           |List the files in the working directory|
|`cd [new directory]` |Change the working directory to [new directory]|
|`pwd`          |Print the full pathname of the working directory|
|`mkdir [options] [name]`|Make a directory with name [name]|
|`rm [options] [name]`  |Remove a file or directory with name [name] (be careful, theres no warning)|
|`gcc [options] [name]` |Compile a .c file with name [name]|

# Hello World!
The first thing you'll learn how to do when starting a new programming language is learning how to print out "Hello World!". This is arguably one of the simplest things to do, but if you're completely new to programming it might get a tad bit confusing. Open up Terminal, make a directory (a folder) and move to it. Then make a new `.c` file and open it in the editor of your choice. If you're unsure, try `emacs`.
```bsh=\
riyo$ mkdir helloworld
riyo$ cd helloworld
riyo$ emacs helloworld.c
```
Here you'll be greeted with a text editor where you can type in your code. For the time being just copy the below text into the window:


```c=
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
   printf("Hello World!\n");
   return 0;
}
```
Before we can run our program, we need to compile it. This is where we run our code through a translator and convert it to something computers can understand. The compiler we will be using is called `gcc`. Run the commands below to compile and run the program.
```bsh
riyo$ gcc -Wall -Werror -O -o helloworld helloworld.c
riyo$ ./helloworld
Hello World!
riyo$ 
```
### A note on gcc
`gcc` is an application that compiles our code, and we can compile with different settings according to the flags we run it with. In the above terminal output, we ran `gcc` with the flags:
- `-Wall` : set all warnings on
- `-Werror` : treat warnings as errors
- `-O` : optimisation
- `-o helloworld` : make the output file `helloworld`

### But how does it work!?
The first line `#include <stdio.h>` tells the compiler to copy all of a header file (stdio.h) into your program. This allows you to use functions in those header files. In this case, stdio.h is a header file that contains the functions on input and output (pretty stupid considering all programs will need input and output). Further along into this course, you'll be introduced to other libraries that will simplify your code. 

The line `int main(int argc, char *argv[]){` is the start of a function, which needs to be closed off with a `}` (you can see this on the final line). Every C program has a main function, a function that is called as soon as the program is executed. 

`int` is the return type of the function, we will learn more about this later.

`main` is the name of the function. All C programs need a main function.

`(int argc, char *argv[])` are the arguments of the function, or what information is going to be passed to the function. More on this in the Functions chapter.

`printf` is a 'command' that allows us to 'print' or display some text. The `\n` is a new line character, try this program without it and see what happens.

`return 0;` is what the function returns when it is completed. When 0 is returned, that tells the OS that everything worked out fine and there was no issue. You'll learn more about returns in the Functions chapter.

Another thing to keep in mind is that every 'command' or 'instruction' is always ended with a semicolon.

# C Data Types
When dealing with any programming of any kind, we will always need a way to store certain information, retrieve it and manipulate it. Everything we need to store can be stored in a series of bits, quite simply a string of either zeroes or ones. This is where we can start to use the plethora of built in variables C has to offer. Below is a table of C data types (stolen from Wikipedia), and their respective format specifier.

|Type|Description|Format Specifier
|-|-|-|
|`char`|Smallest addressable unit of the machine that can contain basic character set. It is an integer type. Actual type can be either signed or unsigned depending on the implementation. Use it to hold ASCII letters.|`%c`|
|`int`|Basic signed integer type. Capable of containing at least the [âˆ’32767, +32767] range; thus, it is at least 16 bits in size.  |`%d`|
|`long int`|Long signed integer type. Capable of containing at least the [âˆ’2147483647, +2147483647] range; thus, it is at least 32 bits in size.  |`%li`|
|`long long int`|Long long signed integer type. Capable of containing at least the [âˆ’9223372036854775807, +9223372036854775807] range; thus, it is at least 64 bits in size. Specified since the C99 version of the standard. |`%lli`|
|`float`|A floating point number, similiar to int but can hold decimals.  |`%f`|
|`double`|A double precision floating point number, similiar to float but can hold more decimals, thus more accurate. |`%f`|

You can also call `signed` or `unsigned` before certain data types to hold a greater value (but essentially the same range) by sacrificing any negative representation. i.e a `signed int` has a range of [32767, +32767], but an `unsigned int` would have a value of [0,+65534].

# Input and Output
## `printf`
We've briefly touched upon `printf` in the Hello World chapter in printing predefined messages, but we can also use `printf` to print out the values of certain variables. Using the format specifier (look in the table in the C Data Types chapter), we can print out an integer as follows:
```c=
int main(){
  int a=7;
  printf("And the number is... %d!\n",a);
  return 0;
}
```
`%d` tells the compiler to print out an integer, and that integer is referenced just before the `printf` statement ends. You can also print multiple integers but you must reference them in order. Below is an example:
```c=
int main(){
  int a=7,b=12,c=14;
  printf("Integer A = %d\nInteger B = %d\nInteger C = %d\n",a,b,c);
  return 0;
}
```
## `scanf`
We can ask for input from the user in a similiar way to printing out a variable
```c=
int main(){
  int a;
  scanf("%d",&a);
  printf("The entered number was %d\n",a);
  return 0;
}
```
Remember, when using `scanf`, we need to use an `&` before we reference our variable. We will go into why in the pointers chapter.

More functions about input will be covered later in the course.

# Making Choices
Throughout this course you will have to implement algorithms that compare or contrast different information and act upon that information differently. To compare values, we use the `if` statement.
## `if-else` Statements
```c=
if(/*conditions to be satisfied*/){
  // if above condition is satisfied, do things contained in these
  // curly brackets
}
```
You can also make use of multiple `if` statements by using an `else if` statement right after the initial if statement.
```c=
else if(/*conditions to be satisfied*/){
  // if above condition is satisfied, do things contained in these
  // curly brackets
}
else{
  // this else statement is for any other case not satisfying the above
}
```
One thing to note is that if the first if statement is satisfied and called, any subsequent else if or else statements will not be called. If you need to check multiple conditions, its better to write multiple if statements that are unrelated to each other.

You can also nest if statements inside of each other.
## Writing Conditions
There is a certain notation that you need to learn to properly implement the correct conditions inside your `if` statements.

|Condition Operator|Description|Example|
|-|-|-|
|`==`|Check whether two variables are equivalent. Does not work very well with floating or double precision, in those cases you should subtract the value with what you want to equate it with and check if the difference is negligible.|`if(a==b)`|
|`!=`|Check whether two variables are not equivalent.|`if(a!=b)`|
|`>, < , >=, <=`| Greater than and less than. Use an equal sign after to check for greater or less than or equivalent to.|`if(a >= b)`|
|`||`|Checks multiple conditions seperated by `||`. At last one condition needs to be satisfied for the if statement to be called| `if(a==123 || b == 321)`|  
|`&&`|  Checks multiple conditions that are seperated by `&&`. Both conditions need to be satisfied for the if statement to be called.|`if(a != b && b == 120)`|

## `switch` Statements
An faster but far more restrictive version of the if statement is the switch statement. Below is an example that checks for user input at a menu screen. 

Using an `if-else` statement
```c=
scanf("%c",&input);
if(input=="a"){
  // a is called
}
else if(input=="b"){
  // b is called
}
else if(input=="c"){
  // c is called
}
else{
  printf("Invalid Command!\n" );
}
```

Using a `switch` statement

```c=
scanf("%c",&input);
switch(input) {
  case 'A' :
    // a is called
    break;
  case 'B' :
    // b is called
    break;
  case 'C' :
    // c is called
    break;
  default :
    printf("Invalid Command!\n" );
}
```
You should take note that the `break` statement is critical. If you miss it, it will call any code after that until either the `switch` statement ends, or a `break` is reached. The `default` case is the case where none of the other cases were called.
# Functions
Often when programming, we have to reuse a small block of code multiple times. It makes little sense to copy and paste the blocks of code, so we make use of something called functions. Functions are written exactly like the main function you've already seen. They have a type, a name and input parameters. An example is shown below:

```c=
int someFunction(int a, int b, int c){
  // do something with the inputs
  int r = a+b+c / abc * 21;
  return r;
}
```
The above function has a type int. This means that after all it's calculations are done, it will return an int. Next is the name of the function, someFunction. We use this to call the function in our code. Next are the arguments, int a, int b, int c. We can have an infinite amount of arguments coming in, but we can't really edit them inside someFunction. The name of the arguments are only relevant to the code inside the function, and any integers coming into the function are 'copies' of the original. Meaning if I pass in int z into some function, whatever edits I make to z are only done to the copies made inside the function. To make edits to them we have to either return the value, or utilise something called pointers, covered in another topic. Inside the function itself, we declare int r. This int only exists inside the function and will be destroyed once the function finishes its job.

One thing to note is that when compiling, gcc needs to know what functions exist in the file before they are called. This can be done by having the function defined before it is called (can get messy with large projects), or with function prototypes, just after the #include's. A function prototype for our someFunction looks like:
```c=
int someFunction(int a, int b, int c);
```
or
```c=
int someFunction(int , int , int );
```
The name of the input arguments aren't required, all gcc needs to know is that there are going to be three int's coming into the function, and that function will return an int. 

To call the function all we need to do is:
```c=
int myInt = someFunction(2,3,2);
```
The above line sets myInt to whatever someFunction will return when given 2 as a, 3 as b and 2 as c as input. Remember, order matters when calling a function.

# Loops
Often times when implementing an algorithm, we need to do things multiple times, and the amount of times we do that certain task can change. For problems like these, we use loops. There are three types of loops that all essentially achieve the same goal.
## `while` Loop
The while loop only requires one parameter to run, that is, the condition for it to run. An example is shown below:
```c=
while(i<500){
  // do something
  i++;
}
```
This loops until `i` no longer is smaller than 500. One particular issue some students tend to forget about is incrementing `i`. If `i` is never incremented (it is above using `i++`), you'll be stuck in an infinite loop at your program will never end.
## `for` Loop
A for loop is very similiar to a while loop, but it lets us increment and initialise our values inside our conditions. An example is shown below.
```c=
for(i=0; i<500; i++){
  // do something
}
```
This loop is a line shorter than a while, and takes care of the increment for you. Also, take note of the use of semicolons, that is, there are only two, not three. The integer must also be declared outside of the loop.
## `do-while` Loop
We probably don't cover `do-while` loops in this course, so it shouldn't be something you need to worry about. Although, if you're interested...
```c=
int main(){
  int i;
  // do a do-while loop here!
  return 0;
}
```
## Breaking a Loop
There are multiple ways to break a loop other than no longer satisfying the loop conditions. You can call break;, or return;. Prematurely calling return will actually break from the entire function. Another method to break from a loop is to satisfy the conditions early. In the example of the while loop above, to break from it early, we can just set i = 500, and the loop will not run after the current interation.

# Arrays and Strings
## Arrays
Sometimes we need a whole set of data and declaring them like
```c
int a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l ...
```
can get tedious and downright ugly. For situations like these, we use something called an array. To declare 26 `int`s, we can just write
```c
int myarray[5];
```
and to access the n'th element, we write
```c
myarray[n]
```
Here is a diagram of what (roughly) the memory looks like.

|[g]|[g]|[g]|[g]|[g]|[g] |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|1|2|3|4|5|

The `[g]` means that this area is what we call garbage values. It is random data, and in most instances should be initialised to 0. To initialise an entire array to 0 we
```c
int emptyArray[5] = {0};
```
and now our array looks something like

|0|0|0|0|0|0|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|1|2|3|4|5|

If you have already created your array and you need to initialise everything to 0, you will need to loop through every element and set each to 0.
```c
int i;
for(i=0; i<size; i++){
  myarray[i] = 0;
}
```
Remember that the very first element of the array is at n=0. You do have to be extremely careful about accessing an array out of its bounds, as the compiler will not give a warning about it, but you may have a segmentation fault. A segmentation fault is an error which crashes the program, because you have attempted to edit memory you are now allowed to access. Dereferencing (fancy way of saying reading the data) memory you have not been given access to is fine. To initialise all the elements of the array to `0`, we set the array equal to `{0}`.

## Strings
A string is an array of `char`'s, but they have one bonus feature. Instead of keeping track of how many items an array has, so we don't overstep our bounds, a string takes advantage of the `NULL` character. The `NULL` character has value 0, and is usually designated by the character `\0`. A string containing the word "hello" is shown below.

|h|e|l|l|o|\0 |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|

We access each character with the same syntax as arrays, and every operation you can do with arrays can be done in the exact same manner to a string. Below, we will use the `NULL` character to determine how long a particular string is.
```c=
int stringlength(char *word){
  int i = 0;
  while(word[i]!='\0'){
    i++;
  }
  return i;
}
```
Notice how in our function argument, we are taking in a `*word`. This is what we call a pointer, and its how arrays and strings are referenced. More on this in the Pointers chapter.

What we are doing is we loop through each character in the string until we reach the `NULL` character, incrementing an `int` every loop. Once we reach that `NULL` character, we break from the loop and `return i`, which is the length of the string. There are plenty of functions related to strings available in the `string.h` library, but you should learn how to implement them yourself.
# Pointers
Every time we declare a variable, a small portion of memory is allocated to store that variable, and is given an address. This address is called a pointer. Sometimes it makes more sense to pass the address of a variable into a function, rather than the value. We declare a `int` pointer by
```c
int * p;
```
This is a pointer that can point to an `int`. If we create an `int` and point `p` to it
```c
int someint = 200;
p = &someint;
```
we can now edit the value in `someint` by only referencing the pointer `p`. Using the `&` notation, we set `p` to the address of `someint`. So if we
```c
*p = 30;
```
`someint` is now equal to 30, even though we haven't mentioned `someint`, we have only mentioned the pointer that had the address of `someint`. This works especially well when implementing functions that need to return more than a single value. Rather than returning a value, we can pass in pointers into the function for the function to edit them. Lets suppose we want to write a function that takes in two `int`'s, `int a` and `int b`. It will store the bigger of the two into `int a` and the smaller into `int b`. Here's an incorrect solution:
```c=
void bigswap(int a, int b){
  int temp;
  if(a<b){
    temp = a;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
  }
}
```
This is incorrect because of a special thing that `c` does when calling functions. It calls functions, not with `int a` and `int b`, but duplicates with the same data. Meaning, once we leave the function, any edits we made to `int a` and `int b` are not saved. Instead, we need to use pointers to edit the values in memory.
```c=
void bigswap(int *a, int *b){
  int temp;
  if(*a < *b){
    temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
  }
}
```
Notice how we used a `*` before `a` and `b`. This is called dereferencing, and thats basically a fancy way of saying "get the value inside this memory address". You can do some very dangerous things with pointers, as you're dealing with actual memory addresses. Make sure you never overstep your bounds and write to a place to not meant to write to. 

## Pointers to Arrays
When we pass in arrays into functions, we aren't actually passing in a copy of the entire array into the function in the same way as passing a single `int` would. Instead, we are passing in a pointer to the first element of the array. This means that when we edit an element within an array in a seperate function, we are actually editing the value after we've broken out of the function. A good thing to note here is that
```c
myArray[1]
```
is the exact same thing as
```c
*(myArray+1)
```

## Heap Allocation
### Areas of Memory
- Talk about stack
- and about heap

### `malloc`
One thing about `C` is that we cannot dynamically declare an array size, that is, if we don't know the size of an array before hand, we can't make an array of that size. So something like this is invalid
```c=
int main(){
  int size;
  scanf("%d",&size);
  int myarray[size] = {0};
  return 0;
}
```
Instead, we need to dynamically allocate space for the array. To do this, we use a function called `malloc`, and it allocates some space for us on the heap and returns a pointer to it. If it cannot allocate any space, it will return a `NULL` pointer. Below is the correct version.
```c=
#include <stdlib.h> // need this for malloc

int main(){
  int size;
  scanf("%d",&size);
  int *myarray = malloc(sizeof(int) * size);
  return 0;
}
```
`malloc` actually takes in the amount of bytes we want to allocate, so we use the `sizeof` function to find how many bytes an `int` is, and we multiply that by how many `int`'s we want. It's also good to note that `C` doesn't bother remembering the bounds on the memory, so its the programmer's job to make sure we never overstep our bound.
### `realloc`
If we ever need to reallocate space that we've allocated, we can use the `realloc` function. Suppose we create an array with 100 elements
```c
int *myArray = malloc(sizeof(int) * 100);
```
and now we realise we need 120, so we
```c
realloc(myArray, sizeof(int)*120);
```
Remember, `malloc` and `realloc` takes in a pointer and the amount of **bytes** you need. So always make sure you allocate enough space.

### `free`
When we dynamically allocate space, we need to free it up after we're done using the space. If we don't, we encounter something called a memory leak. This isn't a compiler error, nor will it make your program crash like a segmentation fault, but it is horrendous practice, and some marks in your assignment will probably go towards that. To check for memory leaks, we first compile our program will the flag `-g` (`-gdwarf-2` on non-CSE machines). Then we run a program called `valgrind`. As this isn't something that is heavily looked at in this course, I'm not going to go through it, but you should read up on it. 

To free allocated memory, we just
```c
free(myArray);
```
Thats it. As long as `myArray` is a pointer to some memory you dynamically allocated, you're set.

# Structs
## Making a New Data Type
Sometimes the standard data types aren't particularly suited for an application, like `int`'s for describing points in a Cartesian coordinate system. For this, we can create `struct`'s and create our own data type using the standard data types as building blocks. Below we'll define a `Point` for a two-dimensional cartesian plane.
```c
struct coordinate{
  int x;
  int y;
}
```
Now to access the things inside the `struct` (which are called members), we
```c
struct coordinate pointA;
pointA.x = 100;
pointA.y = 20;
```
or to save a bit of time
```c
struct coordinate pointA = {100,20};
```

## `typedef`'ing
Writing out `struct coordinate` everytime for can get a bit tedious, so we can utilise something called a `typedef`.
```c
typedef struct coordinate Coordinate;
```
Now instead of writing out `struct coordinate`, we can just write `Coordinate`.
```c
Coordinate c = {1,1};
```

We can also combine our `typedef`'s and our `struct` decleration together.
```c
typedef struct _coordinate{
  int x;
  int y;
}Coordinate;
```
It's good style to have an underscore for our `struct` name, as we have above.
# Recursion
Functions in `C` have the ability to call itself, this is called recursion. First lets go through an iterative function
```c
int getStringLength(char * word){
  int i = 0;
  while(word[i]!='\0'){
    i++;
  }
  return i;
}
```
Our case to stop incrementing is when `word[i] == '\0'`. Now to write a recursive implementation, we need to look at this function and try to rewrite it so that we can replace the loop with a recursive call. This means that the argument of the function needs to be something that can stay the same, regardless of whether its a recursive call or not. We also need a base case, something that our function will check to know when to stop. For `getStringLength` we stop at `'\0'`. 

```c
int recursiveStringLength(char * word){
  if(*word == '\0'){
    return 0;
  }
  return 1 + recursiveStringLength(word+1);
}
```

The base case in our function is when we get a `char` pointer to a string where the first character is a `'\0'`. If we encounter this empty string, we `return 0;`, and this will break us out of the function and it's recursive calls. If we get anything but an empty string, we `return 1 + recursiveStringLength(word+1);`, that is, we add 1 to whatever the recursive function returns with the pointer to the char immidietly after the current one. If we follow through with this, we can see that for every non-empty pointer to a char (and by non-empty I mean, not containing `'\0'`), we add one.

There is no mechanical way of writing recursive functions, but it will come with practice.

# Dynamic Data Structures
## Linked Lists
Utilising pointers and `struct`'s, we can create a new data type called linked lists. Each item in the linked list is called a node, and each node contains some data and a pointer to another node.
```c
typedef struct _lnode{
  int data;
  struct _lnode * next;
}*Lnode;
```
The amazing thing about linked lists is that, it's size can change on demand. This is because there is no actual structure containing the pointers of each and every node. Rather, the `n`'th node can only be accessed by accessing the `n-1`'th node. To access a linked list, we only have a pointer to the very first node. The very last node in a list has it's `next` pointer to `NULL`. There are differing implementations of linked lists, the alternative is another struct that contains pointers to the head of the linked list and/or other stuff. For Alan Blair's course, we normally deal with the implementation shown above.

A sample linked list is shown below
```
+-----+-+   +-----+-+   +-----+-+   +-----+-+   
| 15  |-|-->| 21  |-|-->| 0   |-|-->| 44  |-|--> NULL
+-----+-+   +-----+-+   +-----+-+   +-----+-+
```
One of those boxes is a single node, and as said before, each node contains a pointer to the next pointer. So to access the node that contains `0`, we need access to the node that contains `21`, and to access that one, we need access to the node with `15`. Every node relies on the pointer in the previous node.

To create a node for a linked list, we need to dynamically allocate space
```c
Lnode newNode(int value){
  Lnode l = malloc(sizeof(struct _lnode));
  l->data = value;
  l->next = NULL;
  return l;
}
```
Notice even though we are dealing with pointers to nodes, we didn't use the `*` notation for referencing an `Lnode`. This is because in our `typedef` we wrote:
```c
typedef struct _lnode{ blah blah } *Lnode;
```
If we didn't have that `*` there, `Lnode` would be the same as writing `struct _lnode`, and if we wanted a pointer to a node, we would have to write `Lnode *`. Depending on how the lecturer writes the ADT, it might be different.

To append a node to the end of a linked list, we need to traverse through the entire linked list until we reach the last node, then attach our new node to that.

```c
Lnode append(Lnode head, Lnode node){
  if(head==NULL) return node; // edge case: empty list
  Lnode curr = head;
  while(curr->next!=NULL) curr = curr->next;
  curr->next = node;
  return head;
}
```
This might be a big jump, but stick with me. An empty list is defined as a pointer to `NULL` which is address `0x0`. So if the list is empty, we can just return the node we need to append. If the list isn't empty, we need to traverse through the list, node by node, until we reach the end. So we create a temporary variable called `curr` that contains the address of the `head` node. We use a while loop and keep going through the list until we reach the very last node. The very last node has a particular property, that is, it's next pointer is `NULL`. So once we've reached the last node, we set that node's next pointer to the node we are adding, then we return the head of the linked list.


## Binary Trees
Binary trees are very similiar to linked lists, but instead of a node containing the pointer to the next node, it contains two pointers to nodes. This creates a tree-like structure. To traverse through trees, you need a strong grasp of either stacks, or recursion.

# Machine Language
Now for a very different part of the course. We don't cover anymore `C` for this section, rather we try to implement certain programs at the very lowest level we possibly can, machine code. The simulator used in 1917 is usually `mlsim`, which you can find in the lab section of WebCMS. I wrote my own version of `mlsim` called `amlsfc`, which (imo) has a much nicer interface and is significantly easier to use. Use either, as they both simulate the same machine. 

Each command is 4 bytes long, and the first byte corresponds to an OPCODE. The list of OP codes are shown below.
|OPCODE|Instruction|
|-|-|
|`1RXY`|Copy the value stored in address `XY` into register `R`|
|`2RXY`|Copy the bit pattern `XY` into register `R`|
|`3RXY`|Do something|

When we edit addresses, we edit 2 bytes at a time, and when the machine reads two bytes at a time. The exam questions for this topic basically ask you to decipher what is going on in a program, and to write the equivalent `C` code, so lets go through some examples.
