# COMP2121
## Course Info

+ There are 5 sets of lab exercises, 2 weeks to work on each, marked every other week. (can be done and marked early)
+ You will need a usb/some system to take your work away from electrical labs. 
+ Thursday lecture has an hour afterwards for help if needed. 
+ First lab is in week 3

## AVR ISA / Programming

### The Chip
The AVR Industry Standard Architecture (AVR ISA) is governed by the AVR Instruction set and includes:

1. Load-Store memory access architecture
	+ This means all calcualtions are done on registers, not memory directly. 
	+ Memory is used to **load** to registers or **store** the registers contents. 
2. Two-Stage instruction pipelining
	+ This just means that the processor is designed to split up each instruction into multiple steps
	allowing for the processor to run multiple instructions in parralell. This increases speed as the processor
	can start another instruction before finishing the first as some parts of the new instruction use peices of the 
	processor not currently active in the previous instructions computation. 
3. Internal Memory
4. lots of on-chip peripherals (hardware addons)

### General Registers
The AVR has 32 8-bit registers that are extremely quick to access and work with.
We split these up into two groups, the 0-15 registers (r0-r15) and 16-31 (r16-r31)
This is because some instructions will only be able to function when working with
registers of the second higher number groups. why?
most instructions only have 16 bits to work with so for a command like ldi you have
`1110 kkkk aaaa aaaa`
1110 indicates the command, kkkk is the return register and aaaa aaaa is the address to 
read from. because it only has 4 bits to store the return register, it can only return 
to a maximum possible 16 different registers. Hence why it only works on the second group of registers. 

The following register pairs are commonly used as address indexs
* X - r27:r26
* Y - r29:r28
* Z - r31:r30

note that often data loaded from program memory goes to r0

###Commands
note: In AVR a *word* is a 16 bit value

| Command   | Function | Words | Cycles | Comments       |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------|----------------|
| sub Rd, Rr| Rd - Rr  | 1     |      1 | does not carry |
| mul Rd, Rr| Rd*Rr    | 1     |      2 | returns result in r1:r0 as 2 8bit values can give a maximum 16 bit return value also note the flag C is set if bit 15 of the result is set. helping indicate excessivly large values rather then overflow which C usually signals. This is because overflow is not possible here| 
| ldi Rd, k | Rd <- k | 1 | 1| loads from address k into Rd |
| mov Rd, Rr| Rd <- Rr | 1| 1| moves one register to another |
| add Rd, Rr| Rd + Rr | 1| 1| doesn't carry |

###Example

lets say we want to calculate `z = 2x - xy - x^2` we can do it as below.
note that when we get a 16 bit result we throw away the least significant half
because we know what we are working with fits within the most significant 8 bits. 
Also note that we use r16 as it will work with any instruction so it's a safe bet.

Assuming x y and z are stored in r2, r3 ad r4 (r0 and r1 are used by mul)

```
ldi r16, 2      		r16 <- 2;
mul r16, r2     		x*2;
mov r5, r0      		r5 <- x*2;
mul r2, r3      		y * x;
sub r5, r0      		r5 <- 2x - y*x;
mul r2, r2      		x*x;
sub r5, r0      		r5 <- 2x-y*x - x^2;
mov r4, r5      		finish;
```
Note that because mul takes 2 cycles we can cut down the time this takes by doing
` z = x(2 - (y + x)) `
